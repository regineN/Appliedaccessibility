<p>"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience.This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web. Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:</p>
<p> 

- have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup<br>

- ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content<br>

- create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly<br>
</p>

<p> I used <strong>Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element.</strong></p>
<p>HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup.</p>
<p>The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality</p>
<p>I used <strong>Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for better accessibility.</strong></p>
<p>The form topic covers accessibility of radio buttons. Each choice is given a label with a for attribute tying to the id of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.</p>
