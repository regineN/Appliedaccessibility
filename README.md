<p>"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience.This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web.
